### Injury Prevention Priorities:

**Weaknesses:**

- Left ankle weakness/instability (starts become sore and hurt after 45 kilometers)

**Required:** 2-3 strength sessions per week focusing on:
1. Single-leg stability (step-ups, single-leg deadlifts, goblet squats)
2. Knee strengthening (squats, lunges, Bulgarian split squats, step-downs)
3. Ankle stability & proprioception (calf raises, balance work, elastic band exercises)
4. Hip/glute activation (bridges, clamshells, lateral walks)
5. Core stability for running economy
6. Eccentric loading for injury resilience

**Home Gym Equipment:**
- Kettlebells, dumbbells, resistance bands, yoga mat
- Reebok step board (15cm/20cm/25cm)

### Training Plan Guidelines:

**Must Include:**
- 2-3 dedicated strength sessions weekly (atleast 40 min each)
- Progressive volume build toward 100-mile goal
- Active recovery between hard efforts

**Schedule Constraints:**
- Tuesday running already scheduled (11 km)
- Wednesday evening unavailable (swim session)
- Plan long runs on weekends, 
- noon swim when scheduled on Saturday
- Strength can be done early morning, or after work
- Bike commute day should be strategic (not day before/after key workouts) and not on Tuesdays
